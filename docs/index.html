<h1>CMScout</h1>
<p>CMScout is a free and open-source CMS (Content management system) for Scouting related groups from around the world. A CMS is a piece of web software that makes it easy for you to install, and manage a website without needing to know any programming languages. CMScout includes most of the features that other major CMSs include, while adding a few of its own unique features.</p>

<p>CMScout is designed by a Scoutmaster to be used with Scouting. You will never need to install strange, possibly unstable, add ons to get features such as forums, patrol sites, award schemes, photo albums, articles, and more. CMScout is also designed to be used by your average Scoutmaster with a limited knowledge of the internet and computers. Everything is visual, and you only need to look at code for your pages if you really want to.If you are looking for a website for your troop/pack/district/area/country take a look at CMScout. Even if you are not involved in Scouting and just looking for a CMS to use take a look at CMScout!</p>

<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>During the installation process the installer contacts the CMScout website in order for us to track the usage of CMScout. The only information that is transmitted to the CMScout website is the name of your site, the address of your site and what version you have installed. This information is not available to the public, and is kept secure in our database. We do not give this information to anybody, and we do not use this information to contact you in anyway.</p>
